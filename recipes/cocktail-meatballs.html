    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These tender, juicy, flavorful, from scratch Cocktail Meatballs are made with a mix of ground beef and pork meat, and then covered in a delicious sweet and spicy sauce made with honey, orange juice and sriracha!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Meatballs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tsp black peppercorns or 1/2 tsp cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp sea salt</l1>
        <li>1/2 lb pork mince or 1/2 lb chopped pork butt</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (beef mince)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup honey 4 oz / 115 g in weight</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sriracha</li>
        <li>3-4 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Line a half sheet baking tray with foil or parchment paper (so that clean up is easier), and place a wire rack on top. The wire rack should be a cross-wire baking rack. Next, preheat oven to 325°F.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the panko crumbs in a bowl, along with the milk. Allow the breadcrumbs to soak up the milk.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In a spice grinder or small food processor, place the roughly chopped shallots, peeled garlic, black pepper and salt. Process to form a smooth paste.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you’re using pork meat, place the pork meat in the food processor and process until the meat is chopped very finely and is almost like a paste. If you’re using pork mince, just place the mince in the food processor.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the soaked panko, spice mix and the egg to the pork mixture. Pulse the mixture until you have a wet mix that’s almost like a paste.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add half of the beef mince and pulse a few times to mix well. Then add the rest of the beef mince and pulse until almost all of the beef mince has been mixed in.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Scrape the meat mixture into a bowl, and mix the ground meat with a spatula or your hand. Make sure all of the meat and spice mix are well combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Using a small cookie scoop, portion the meat mix. Next, roll these portions into small balls (about 1 – 1 ¼ inches in diameter), using wet hands.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the meatballs on the wire rack, with at least ¾ inch of space between each.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15 – 20 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and allow the meatballs to cool slightly. Then remove the meatballs from the wire rack and allow them to cool completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li>FREEZING FOR LATER – once the meatballs have cooled down completely, place them in an airtight container or a ziploc freezer bag, and freeze for later use. Frozen meatballs can be thawed overnight in the fridge before use.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix the honey, tomato ketchup, ¼ cup sriracha, 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar and orange juice in a pan. Whisk to mix well. Add a pinch of salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat over medium heat until the sauce comes to a simmer. Simmer for about 10 – 15 minutes, while stirring, until the sauce has thickened. Taste and add more salt and more sriracha sauce (up to ¼ cup), if needed. If you want more of the tangy flavor without the spice, add the rest of the balsamic vinegar. Whisk to mix well.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the thawed or room temperature meatballs into the sauce. Stir to coat the meat balls, and let them heat through in the sauce. Simmer for a few more minutes if you want to thicken the sauce more.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the meatballs on a serving tray and spoon some of the sauce over them. Serve warm, with cocktail picks.</li>
