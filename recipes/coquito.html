    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
        <li>1 can cream of coconut</li>
        <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white rum</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</l1>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves; blend until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the refrigerator; serve cold or over ice, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
