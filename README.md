# odin-recipes

A basic recipe website created with HTML. 

Live site: https://phantom-opera.github.io/odin-recipes/

This project demonstrates foundational HTML knowledge that I've learned such as adding headers, and images to web pages and linking from one web page to another.

The coquito and salted caramel ritz cookies recipes were borrowed from allrecipes.com, and the cocktail meatball recipe was taken from theflavorbender.com
